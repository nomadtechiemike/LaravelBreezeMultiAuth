You can add as many roles as you want, just edit the profileController and add the folders/dashbards

Current folder structure:
Views/admin/dashboard.blade.php
Views/user/dashboard.blade.php
Views/manager/dashboard.blade.php

Make sure you add additional routes for other user types, and update the AuthenticatedSessionsController 

 <pre>{
    elseif ($request->user()->role == 'user') {
            $url = '/user/dashboard';
     }
    
}</pre>
